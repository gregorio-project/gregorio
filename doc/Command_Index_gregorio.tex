\section{Gregorio Controls}

These functions are the ones written by gregorio to the gtex file.
While one could, in theory, use/change them to alter the appearance of
elements of the score, it is far better to make your changes in the
gabc file and let gregorio make the changes to the gtex file.

\macroname{\textbackslash GreAnnotationLines}{\#1\#2}{gregoriotex-main.tex}
A wrapper macro for placing annotations above the initial. The
arguments are provided by the \texttt{gabc} file in the
\texttt{annotation} header field.  This macro tests for the presence
of the annotation box which means that the annotation is explicitly
defined in the \texttt{main.tex} file. If so, this macro does nothing,
respecting the annotation value in the \texttt{main.tex} file.
