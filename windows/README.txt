  Congratulations! You have now installed the gregorio typesetting 
  system. Gregorio has no Graphical user interface, it's made to be 
  integrated in a TeX typesetting process. To understand how to use
  gregorio, please visit http://home.gna.org/gregorio/
  It should contain all the necessary details.
  
  To install the Gregorio Support for Scribus, please copy the file
  900_Gregorio.xml from the contrib\ directory of the installation
  directory of Gregorio (ex: C:\Program Files\Gregorio\contrib)
  into the share\editorconfig\ directory of your Scribus install
  (ex: C:\Program Files\Scribus-x.y.z\share\editorconfig).
