README file for Gregorio under DEBIAN GNU/Linux systems

After the installation of gregorio, if you want to benefit from the macros
compiling directly gabc fils in GregorioTeX (like \includescore), you
have to add gregorio to the list of programs allowed to run from TeX
by TeXLive. To do so, you have to modify /etc/texmf/texmf.cnf and add
gregorio to the list 'shell_escape_commands'.
